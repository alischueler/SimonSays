To play Simon Says:
1. Run the game with the initial world state
2. The game will flash a circle, click within the correct circle after waiting one second
3. After clicking on the correct circle, the game will add onto the given sequence and flash the list, with another random circle at the end
4. Click on the circles in the given order after waiting 1 second between end of flash and each click
5. Click anywhere on the screen to continue because the empty list still needs to be clicked to add to the list
6. Repeat steps 4 through 6, for as long as the user wants to play
7. If the user does not click inside the correct circle, or clicks too fast, the game will stop running and display "Wring Circle"
8. To play again, start the program over with the initial word state
